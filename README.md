# Financial LLM/ COPA Evaluator

## Project Overview

This project implements a COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) Evaluator, designed to assess and compare the performance of various large language models (LLM's) on Finacial COPA tasks. The COPA task involves selecting the most plausible cause or effect for a given premise from two alternatives.
I'm developing a Financial COPA dataset aimed at comparing the performance and scoring of different LLM's with the purpose of being able to evaluate how they could support a business in reasoning support AI agents for financial scenarios. 

## Features

- Supports evaluation of multiple models from different providers (currently Ollama and OpenAI)
- Calculates accuracy and timing metrics for each model
- Generates a performance comparison graph
- Saves detailed results to a CSV file for further analysis

Example comparison of llama3.2 and openai-3.5-turbo models performance:

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
    - requests
    - tqdm
    - openai
    - python-dotenv
    - matplotlib

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
```, text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
4. Ensure you have Ollama running locally if you plan to use Ollama models

## Usage

1. Prepare your COPA dataset in JSONL format
2. Modify the `models` list in `main.py` to include the models you want to evaluate
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Output

- Console output with accuracy and timing metrics for each model
- A CSV file with detailed results for each question
- A PNG image showing a performance comparison graph of all evaluated models

## Customization

- Adjust the `debug` parameter in `COPAEvaluator` initialization to enable/disable detailed output
- Modify the `format_prompt` method to change how prompts are constructed for the models

## Roadmap

- Further develop the validation dataset
  - Focus on financial complexity reasoning only? Decide if the dataset should be pruned to remove superfluous questions not serving the direct COPA.
- Get third party affiration 
  - Academic verification needed for the FCOPA dataset. The current dataset is indicative, not affirmed.
- Add localization
  - Today the FCOPA is based on english datasets. We know for a fact that introducing localization will break the scoring due to lingual training biases
